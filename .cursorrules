You are a senior Dart programmer with experience in the Flutter framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## Project-Specific Guidelines for FamSync

### Architecture & Structure
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow the established pattern with `core/`, `data/`, `domain/`, `ui/` layers
- **Repository Pattern**: All data access goes through repository classes in `lib/data/`
- **Riverpod State Management**: Use `flutter_riverpod` for all state management
- **GoRouter Navigation**: Use `go_router` for navigation with proper route definitions
- **Dependency Injection**: Use `get_it` for service locator pattern
- **Freezed Models**: All domain models use `freezed` for immutability and JSON serialization

### File Organization
- **UI Components**: Place in `lib/ui/screens/` for screens, `lib/ui/widgets/` for reusable widgets
- **Theme System**: Use `lib/theme/` for all styling, colors, and responsive utilities
- **App Bar**: Use `lib/ui/appbar/fam_app_bar_scaffold.dart` for consistent app bar implementation
- **Strings**: Centralize all text in `lib/ui/strings.dart` using `AppStrings` class
- **Icons**: Use `lib/ui/icons.dart` for custom icon definitions

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to Flutter

### Basic Principles

- Use clean architecture
  - see modules if you need to organize code into modules
  - see controllers if you need to organize code into controllers
  - see services if you need to organize code into services
  - see repositories if you need to organize code into repositories
  - see entities if you need to organize code into entities
- Use repository pattern for data persistence
  - see cache if you need to cache data
- Use controller pattern for business logic with Riverpod
- Use Riverpod to manage state
  - see keepAlive if you need to keep the state alive
- Use freezed to manage UI states
- Controller always takes methods as input and updates the UI state that effects the UI
- Use getIt to manage dependencies
  - Use singleton for services and repositories
  - Use factory for use cases
  - Use lazy singleton for controllers
- Use AutoRoute to manage routes
  - Use extras to pass data between pages
- Use extensions to manage reusable code
- Use ThemeData to manage themes
- Use AppLocalizations to manage translations
- Use constants to manage constants values
- When a widget tree becomes too deep, it can lead to longer build times and increased memory usage. Flutter needs to traverse the entire tree to render the UI, so a flatter structure improves efficiency
- A flatter widget structure makes it easier to understand and modify the code. Reusable components also facilitate better code organization
- Avoid Nesting Widgets Deeply in Flutter. Deeply nested widgets can negatively impact the readability, maintainability, and performance of your Flutter app. Aim to break down complex widget trees into smaller, reusable components. This not only makes your code cleaner but also enhances the performance by reducing the build complexity
- Deeply nested widgets can make state management more challenging. By keeping the tree shallow, it becomes easier to manage state and pass data between widgets
- Break down large widgets into smaller, focused widgets
- Utilize const constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds

### Testing

- Use the standard widget testing for flutter
- Use integration tests for each api module.

## FamSync-Specific UI Guidelines

### Responsive Design (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER use hardcoded values** for spacing, sizing, or dimensions
- **Always use responsive tokens**: `context.spaces.*`, `context.layout.*`, `context.sizes.*`
- **Responsive utilities**: Use `lib/theme/responsive.dart` extensions for `isSmall`, `isMedium`, `isLarge`
- **Spacing tokens**: Use `AppSpacing` class with responsive values (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`)
- **Sizing tokens**: Use `AppSizes` class for consistent component dimensions
- **Layout calculations**: Use `spaces.xxl * 6` instead of hardcoded `240.0`

### App Bar Implementation
- **Use FamAppBarScaffold**: Always use `lib/ui/appbar/fam_app_bar_scaffold.dart`
- **Consistent heights**: Use `expandedHeight: spaces.xxl * 6` for standard app bars
- **Header builders**: Implement `headerBuilder` for custom app bar content
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Use `AppGradients.hubHeaderLight/Dark` for consistent theming

### Error Handling & User Experience
- **ResponsiveErrorWidget**: Use `lib/ui/widgets/responsive_error_widget.dart` for error states
- **Loading states**: Implement proper loading indicators with responsive sizing
- **Error boundaries**: Handle Firestore permission errors gracefully
- **User feedback**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Firebase Integration
- **Auth Repository**: Use `lib/data/auth/auth_repository.dart` for authentication
- **Firestore Rules**: Follow security best practices in `firestore.rules`
- **Subscription Management**: Always cancel Firestore listeners in `dispose()` methods
- **Error Handling**: Handle network and permission errors gracefully

### State Management Patterns
- **Riverpod Providers**: Use `ConsumerWidget` and `ConsumerStatefulWidget` consistently
- **AsyncValue**: Handle loading, data, and error states properly
- **State Updates**: Use `ref.read()` for actions, `ref.watch()` for UI updates
- **Provider Organization**: Group related providers in dedicated files

### Code Quality & Comments
- **Extensive commenting**: Add comments every 3-6 lines, especially for new code blocks
- **Multi-line comments**: Use detailed explanations for complex logic
- **Function documentation**: Explain the purpose and behavior of each function
- **Variable context**: Comment on why specific values or approaches were chosen
- **Avoid AI-like language**: Make comments sound natural and professional

### Performance & Optimization
- **Const constructors**: Use `const` wherever possible to reduce rebuilds
- **Widget extraction**: Break large widgets into smaller, focused components
- **ListView optimization**: Use `ListView.builder` for dynamic content
- **Memory management**: Properly dispose of controllers and subscriptions

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- **Responsive layouts**: Ensure UI works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Platform-specific code**: Use `Platform.isIOS` and `Platform.isAndroid` when needed
- **Adaptive components**: Use `Cupertino` widgets for iOS and `Material` for Android
- **Screen size handling**: Test on various device sizes and orientations

## Common Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### ✅ DO:
- Use responsive design tokens for all dimensions
- Implement proper error handling with user feedback
- Follow the established file structure and naming conventions
- Use the existing theme system and color schemes
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Cancel subscriptions and dispose resources properly

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use hardcoded pixel values or magic numbers
- Create new state management solutions (stick with Riverpod)
- Skip error handling or loading states
- Ignore responsive design requirements
- Use deprecated Flutter patterns
- Create deeply nested widget trees

### 🔧 When Refactoring:
- **Preserve functionality**: Don't change behavior unless explicitly requested
- **Maintain existing patterns**: Follow the established code structure
- **Add comprehensive comments**: Document all changes and reasoning
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure no regressions in existing features
- **Update related files**: Check for dependencies and update accordingly

## File Naming & Organization
- **Screens**: `lib/ui/screens/[feature]/[feature]_screen.dart`
- **Widgets**: `lib/ui/widgets/[widget_name].dart`
- **Models**: `lib/domain/models/[model_name].dart`
- **Repositories**: `lib/data/[feature]/[feature]_repository.dart`
- **Services**: `lib/core/services/[service_name].dart`
- **Utilities**: `lib/core/utils/[utility_name].dart`

## Dependencies & Imports
- **Core imports first**: Flutter, Riverpod, GoRouter
- **Project imports**: Use relative paths for project files
- **Third-party imports**: Group by functionality
- **Export organization**: One export per file, organized by feature

Remember: This is a family-focused app with real users. Prioritize reliability, performance, and user experience. Always think about how changes will affect the entire family using the app together.
