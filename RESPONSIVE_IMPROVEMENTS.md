);
```

);
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

The app now uses these responsive breakpoints:
- **Small (Mobile)**: 0 - 599px
- **Medium (Tablet)**: 600 - 899px  
- **Large (Desktop)**: 900 - 1199px
- **XLarge (Large Desktop)**: 1200px+

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Hardcoded Values**: All dimensions, strings, and colors now use theme tokens
2. **Responsive Layouts**: All screens adapt to different screen sizes
3. **Material Design Scale**: Text sizes follow Material Design responsive text scale
4. **Touch Targets**: Proper touch target sizes for mobile devices
5. **Flexible Spacing**: Spacing adapts based on screen size and content
6. **Centralized Strings**: All text content is managed in one location
7. **Consistent Theming**: All colors and styles use the theme system

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on Multiple Devices**: Verify layouts work on phones, tablets, and desktops
2. **Test Orientations**: Ensure layouts work in both portrait and landscape
3. **Test Text Scaling**: Verify text remains readable at different system font sizes
4. **Test Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactive elements meet minimum touch target requirements
5. **Test Accessibility**: Verify screen readers can navigate all content properly

## Future Improvements

1. **Landscape Layouts**: Add specific landscape orientation handling
2. **Dynamic Type**: Implement system font size scaling
3. **High DPI Support**: Add support for different pixel densities
4. **Accessibility**: Add semantic labels and improved navigation
5. **Animation Scaling**: Make animations responsive to device performance

## Conclusion

All screens in FamSync are now fully responsive and free of hardcoded values. The app provides an optimal user experience across all device sizes while maintaining clean, maintainable code through centralized string management and responsive utilities.
